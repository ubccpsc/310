# Configuring your environment

To start using this project, you need to get your computer configured so you can build and execute the code. To do this, follow these steps; the specifics of each step (especially the first two) will vary based on which operating system your computer has:

1. [Install git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) (you should be able to execute `git --version` on the command line).

1. [Install Node LTS (8.9.X)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), which will also install NPM (you should be able to execute `node --version` and `npm --version` the command line).

1. Install Yarn using NPM (`sudo npm install -g yarn` on OS X / Linux, `npm install -g yarn` on Windows). You should be able to execute `yarn --version` afterwards.

1. Clone the project: `CPSC310-2017W-T2/cpsc310_d0_teamXXX` (where `XXX` is your team ID). You can find your team ID and clone the repo by visiting your project in GitHub and getting the clone target by clicking on the green button on your project repository.

1. Install your IDE/editor of choice. We suggest [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) which is [free for students](https://www.jetbrains.com/shop/eform/students) and "just works". We also provide limited support for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
